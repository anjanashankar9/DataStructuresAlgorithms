/*
 * Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply
 *  of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? 
 *  The order of coins doesnï¿½t matter.
 *  For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: 
 *  {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, 
 *  there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. 
 *  So the output should be 5.
